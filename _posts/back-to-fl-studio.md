I've decided to try my hand at music again; it's been a while since I've been in FL Studio. It'll still be electronic music, but I'd like to try using electronic sounds with classical instruments this time. I'm mainly inspired by the music of Toby Fox; I really enjoyed it.

I think it's quite effective to learn something new by imitating the best. I've already managed to replicate a couple of his compositions (Snore Symphony, CORE). And I'm already starting to notice some of the techniques Toby uses; I'll have to memorize them and write something of my own.

When I have something to listen to, I'll definitely write another post about it. Then I'll have to slightly refine the Luna engine, specifically how it handles audio files (I'll cover that in a separate post).
